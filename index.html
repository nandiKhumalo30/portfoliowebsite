                    <p> This sparked an intense desire to learn how to code. Two years later the oppotunity presented itself at Umuzi Academy where she trained to become a proficient fullstack web developer.
                    She grasps knowledge quickly, adapts easily to change, has an agile skillset and technology stack. In her training she used new tools like VS-code, Git-Bash, GitHub, Linux, Windows Linux Subsystem and PostgresSQL.

                    Her approach in her career is to have theoretical knowledge and on the job practical training. With this approach she learnt MicroSoft Office and she has worked as an administrator. This makes her pay attention to detail, meticulous and efficient. Her career path includes being a Brand Ambassador for various famous brands.
