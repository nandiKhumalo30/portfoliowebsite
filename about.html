                                 My name is Nandi Khumalo and I am learning how to be a web developer. My Journey as a web developer began at an event I went to for coders. I had no idea what it was but it was exciting to see people solve everyday problems using code. This was the start of what would spark an intense desire to learn how to code.<br> <br>  Two years later the oppotunity would present itself at Umuzi Academy and I got a chance to be a web developer. This was the oppotunity to see how far coding would take me. I knew this oppotunity would mean I would interact with new tools and learn new skills. It's a field that provides many opportunities for hands-on learning.
